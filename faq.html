            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            
            <h2>How is the sample for testing collected?</h2>
            <p>
                We collect a sample using a nasal swab, which gathers nasal secretions. The swab is gently inserted about 1 inch into the nasal passage (midway) of the nostril with the most visible drainage or the one that is most congested if no drainage is present. The swab is rotated several times, removed carefully, and the process is repeated in the other nostril.
            </p>

            <h2>How and when will I receive my results?</h2>
            <p>
                COVID-19 PCR test results are typically available within 24â€“48 hours after the sample is collected. Once your results are ready, we will send you an email with a secure link to access them online.
            </p>

            <h2>Do I need an appointment, or can I walk in?</h2>
            <p>
                Testing is available by appointment. Walk-ins are not accepted, so please schedule your visit in advance.
            </p>

            <h2>Is a referral from a medical professional required?</h2>
            <p>
                No, you do not need a referral from a healthcare provider to get tested.
            </p>

            <h2>Do you accept insurance?</h2>
            <p>
                We do not directly accept insurance. However, most insurance providers or employers will reimburse you for the testing cost if you submit the receipt, which is automatically emailed to you after payment.
            </p>

            <h2>What is the minimum age for a patient to get a COVID-19 test?</h2>
            <p>
                Patients of any age can register for COVID-19 testing. For minors, a parent or legal guardian must complete the registration. Additionally, children under 15 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian to assist with the swab collection.
            </p>

            <h2>What happens if I miss my appointment?</h2>
            <p>
                You can reschedule your appointment online at no cost up to 24 hours before your scheduled time. If you miss your appointment or attempt to reschedule within 24 hours, only 25% of your testing fee will be refunded.
            </p>

            <h2>Can I bring someone with me, or should I come alone?</h2>
            <p>
                While we understand you may want to bring someone for support, only patients who have completed the online registration and scheduled an appointment will be tested.
            </p>

            <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>
                If you cannot attend your COVID-19 RT-PCR appointment, please adjust your appointment or notify us at least 12 hours in advance. Same-day appointments or cancellations made within 12 hours are subject to our cancellation policy: cancellations within 12 hours incur a 50% charge, and no-shows will be charged 100%.
